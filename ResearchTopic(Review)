 - Research theme - *Plastic detection* need to be modified
 
(Despite the large size, it is very unlikely that we will be able to spot garbage in the pictures we collect. 
we need to find a larger area of focus to analyse.)

 - Describe your experiment and what you plan to investigate. 
Our experiment aims to raise awareness about plastic pollution. We will do this by training a deep learning system to predict the amount of plastic garbage on the collected image.

 - What type of data do you plan to gather?
We will collect images, location of the ISS, and time.
